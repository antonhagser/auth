# OpenID Connect (OAuth2 Social Login) Service Documentation

The OpenID Connect (OAuth2 Social Login) Service enables users to authenticate using third-party services, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, within the system. It provides endpoints for initiating the authentication process, handling the callback from the third-party service, and retrieving user profile information. This service simplifies the login process and allows users to access the system without the need for additional registration.

## Features

-   User authentication using third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter).
-   OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols for secure authorization and user profile information retrieval.
-   Seamless integration with existing user authentication mechanisms.
-   Simplified user experience by eliminating the need for additional registration.

## REST Routes

All routes will start with `/api/v0/`.

## OpenID Connect (OAuth2 Social Login) Service

-   GET `/auth/{provider}/login`: Initiate the authentication process with the specified third-party provider.
-   GET `/auth/{provider}/callback`: Handle the callback from the third-party provider and retrieve user profile information.
-   GET `/auth/{provider}/profile`: Retrieve user profile information from the third-party provider for the authenticated user.

## Usage Example

To initiate the authentication process with a third-party provider (e.g., Google), make a GET request to `/api/v0/auth/google/login`:

```HTTP
GET /api/v0/auth/google/login
```

The system will redirect the user to the provider's authorization page. After the user grants access, the provider will redirect the user back to the /api/v0/auth/google/callback endpoint:

```HTTP
GET /api/v0/auth/google/callback?code={authorization_code}
```

The system will then exchange the authorization code for an access token and retrieve the user's profile information.

## Additional Notes

-   Register your application with each third-party provider you plan to support, obtaining client ID and secret credentials. Ensure that the callback URL is registered with the provider, and configure your application accordingly.
-   Use HTTPS for all API calls related to OpenID Connect (OAuth2 Social Login) to ensure secure transmission of user data and access tokens.
-   Implement proper access token and refresh token management to maintain user authentication and authorization state.
-   Handle account linking when a user logs in with a third-party provider and has an existing account in your system with the same email address. This prevents the creation of duplicate accounts and provides a seamless user experience.
-   Always validate user data retrieved from third-party providers and apply the same security policies as for your own user data.
