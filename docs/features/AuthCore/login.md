# Login Service Documentation

The Login Service is responsible for managing user authentication and session management within the system. It provides endpoints for user login, logout, token refresh, token validation, password reset, and password update. This service ensures secure access to the system by validating user credentials and maintaining access tokens.

## Features

-   User authentication through email and password verification.
-   Session management with access token generation, validation, and expiration handling.
-   Password reset and update functionality for user account security.
-   Token validation for authorization purposes in other services within the system.

## REST Routes

All routes will start with /api/v0/.

## Login Service

-   POST `/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and generate an access token or session ID.
-   POST `/auth/logout`: Invalidate a user's access token or session, logging them out.
-   POST `/auth/refresh`: Refresh a user's access token when it expires.
-   POST `/auth/validate`: Validate a user's access token for authorization purposes.
-   POST `/auth/password-reset/request`: Request a password reset token for a user.
-   POST `/auth/password-reset/confirm`: Confirm the validity of a password reset token.
-   PUT `/auth/password-update`: Update a user's password after a successful reset.

## Usage Example

To authenticate a user, make a POST request to `/api/v0/auth/login` with the email and password:

```http
POST /api/v0/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "P@ssw0rd"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, the response will include an access token or session ID for the user.

## Additional Notes

-   Ensure secure transmission of user credentials by using HTTPS for all login-related API calls.
-   Implement rate-limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks and password guessing.
-   Store passwords using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and use proper password policies to enforce strong user passwords.
